        <h4>Mission</h4>
        <p>First Kind is dedicated to bringing true originality to every endeavor, where technology becomes a medium of art and art informs design, business, and innovation. We blend the vision of an artist with the precision of a developer to create secure, responsive, and ethical solutions shaped by integrity. Guided by an anarchist ethos, we reject conformity and cookie-cutter approaches, instead building authentic partnerships and crafting contemporary solutions that address real-world problemsâ€”one client at a time.</p>
<h4 class="header-four">About Developer</h4>
<p>
 I am a full-stack web developer with a unique foundation that spans English Literature, Creative Writing, Art History, Hospitality, and Team Management. This diverse background gives me the ability to approach problems with both technical precision and creative insight. I specialize in building secure, data-driven, and responsive applications that balance performance, usability, and design.
  </p>
  <p>
My technical expertise includes PHP, JavaScript, React, Node.js, REST APIs, MongoDB, SQL, HTML, and CSS, with a focus on creating scalable, mobile-first solutions. I am equally at home designing intuitive, user-friendly interfaces as I am engineering robust backend frameworks. Beyond development, I am deeply interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence, marketing, and creative tools such as digital audio workstations (DAWs) and plugins. To pursue this, I have earned certifications in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Cybersecurity, and continue to expand my knowledge in these areas.
